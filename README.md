#CS 61C Projects!

###Project 1: Beargit
A simplified version of Git written in C

#####What was Learned
* C Syntax and Intricacies
* Structs

-----

###Project 2: MIPS Assembler and Linker
Created a program in C that converts MIPS instructions into machine code, and links multiple object files.

#####What was Learned
* C Memory Management
* MIPS Instruction Format
* Compiler - Assembler - Linker- Loader

-----

###Project 3: MIPS CPU 
Created the datapath, control scheme, ALU, and Register File for a 2-stage pipelined CPU, with certain custom MIPS instructions.

In order to view the files, use Logisim!

#####What was Learned
* Datapath of a CPU
* Pipelining
* Control Scheme
* Logic Gates

-----

###Project 4:  Performance Programming 
Optimized an algorithm that determined the depth of objects based on two slightly differing images (such as the left eye and the right eye).  Achieved on average 9x-10x speedup.

#####What was Learned
* Steaming SIMD Extensions
* Multithreaded Programming
* Loop Un-rolling
* Open-MP for C Multithreading

-----

###Project 5: Simple Pagerank Algorithm
Utilized Spark to implement a simplified formula of PageRank using Spark.

#####What was Learned
* MapReduce - General approach to solve real life problems
* Spark (Python) and Hadoop (Java)
